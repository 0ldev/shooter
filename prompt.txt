our objective in this program will be to make a mulitplatform (android/ios) application in flutter for gunowners to practice their draw time and shooting speed.
Since we dont have an iphone avaiable, we will give more imprtance to android build, and we will test android build.
the main function of the application is timing up to millisecons the draw speed and time between shots.
We will need a timer widget, a list to display shots fired with the time they we shot in relation to the start of the timer and in relation to previous shot.
We need a start/stop button which activates timer and microphone. 
when timer starts there is a beeping sound. we can set a timer in seconds to start the timer so user has time to get in position and prepare to shoot. 
The app will have a settings page where we can adjust microphone sensitivity in a 0-100% scale and language(pt-br/en-us).
in the settings footer we will have a message developed by Albert Katri.
